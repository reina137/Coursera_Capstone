### Exploring the restaurants of Tokyo - Week 1 report

**Background:**

Just a year is left until 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. Tokyo is my home city, and I decided to focus my search on Tokyo and its restaurants. Probably the resulting data would be helpful for enterpreneurs who is looking forward to start their restaurant in Tokyo. This research can be adapted to check on any possible cuisine or restaurant type.

Tokyo is quite diverse when it comes to dining options. Though the most popular cuisine is Japanese, every other cuisine can be found. There are plenty of Chinese and Korean restaurants, Italian and Indian restaurants. We also have theme restaurants like Ninja cafe, cat cafe, or prisoner cafe (LOL!)

Mexican cuisine is surely popular worldwide, not so much in Japan. That's a pity, because for sure Mexican food is tasty, nutritious and quick to make! Many visitors of 2020 Olympic Games would be totally disappointed if they won't find their favourite tacos or burritos to snack on while cheering  for their Olympic team! Let's have a look at Mexican restaurants in Tokyo, their locations and possible business opportunities.



**1: Business Problem**

A friend of mine, who is currently living in Cancun, Mexico, and running his own Mexican restaurant, contacted me recently. It's just a year until Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games will start, so Tokyo is going to welcome a lot of guests from abroad. My friend was wondering about current situation on Mexican restaurants in Tokyo, is there any Mexican restaurants, and where are they? If he decides to open his own Mexian restaurant, which area should he open it? 



**2: Data**
Tokyo consists of 23 wards, or special areas, which bear a resemblance to New York's boroughs. We've prepared a list of 23 wards and their geolocations in csv format.

First, we will utilize Foursquare API to have a look at what venues are most common for each ward, and cluster these wards. We then use Foursquare API to find information on Mexican restaurants, their locations and ratings.
